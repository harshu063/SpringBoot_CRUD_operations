Spring Boot CRUD Operations (Learning Project)



**Description:-**



This repository contains a basic Spring Boot CRUD application built to understand the core fundamentals of RESTful backend development.



The project demonstrates how a backend service:



Exposes *REST APIs*



Handles HTTP requests and responses



Communicates with both third-party APIs and an own *PostgreSQL database*



Uses *Spring Data JPA* for ORM and persistence



This is not a production-grade backend. It is intentionally kept simple to focus on learning concepts rather than engineering perfection.



**Features:-**



*CRUD* operations using *RESTful APIs*



Proper use of ***HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)***



Integration with *PostgreSQL database*



Use of *Spring Data JPA for* ORM



Interaction with third-party APIs



Request validation and response handling



APIs tested via *Postman*



Clean separation of layers (*Controller, Service, Repository*)



**Tech Stack:-**



Java



Spring Boot



Spring Web



Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)



PostgreSQL



Postman (API testing)



Maven



**Purpose:-**



The sole purpose of this project is learning and practice.



This project was created to:



Understand how REST APIs actually work



Learn request–response flow in Spring Boot



Get comfortable with JPA and database interaction



Practice backend fundamentals before moving to real-world systems



It intentionally avoids:



Advanced security



Caching



Distributed systems



Message queues



Scalability concerns



Production-level exception handling



Because those come later, not at the fundamentals stage.



**Important Note**



⚠️ This is NOT a real backend system.



No authentication or authorization



No role management



No API versioning



No advanced validations



No production-level error handling



No performance optimizations



**This project exists only to build a strong foundation**
